# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-31)

**Core value:** The weekly recommendations (xP table, squad, captains, transfers) must keep flowing reliably — every change must leave the pipeline, API, and site at least as correct and more trustworthy than before.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Test Base Layer & App Skeleton

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Test Base Layer & App Skeleton)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-31 — Roadmap created, 40 v1 requirements mapped across 7 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: React (Vite) rebuild, full 8-page parity, not incremental vanilla enhancement
- Roadmap: API tests come before Playwright — E2E on an untested API inverts the pyramid
- Roadmap: CI ends at a published Docker image, not a live deploy (hosting not purchased)
- Roadmap: Cutover (CUT-01) is its own phase, gated on a full real gameweek cycle

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- **Time-critical, independent of this milestone:** the daily snapshot cron must run every day — price-model history cannot be backfilled (first snapshot 2026-08-31; model unlocks at 14 days). Phase 6 cron changes must not interrupt it.
- **Phase 3 unknown:** FPL shirt/kit CDN URL patterns are unverified community knowledge. Must be captured from live devtools before building the shirt component; trademark posture must be documented, not deferred.
- **Phase 5 unknown:** Python 3.14 (`cp314`) wheel availability for LightGBM, scikit-learn, PyArrow, PuLP is in flux. Verify on PyPI before finalizing the lockfile.
- **Milestone invariant:** the vanilla site stays live and authoritative until CUT-01 completes.
- Payment gateway / merchant-of-record choice still pending with the user — out of scope here, but PITCH-01's trademark disclaimer feeds the eventual gateway review.
