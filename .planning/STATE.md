# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-31)

**Core value:** The weekly recommendations (xP table, squad, captains, transfers) must keep flowing reliably — every change must leave the pipeline, API, and site at least as correct and more trustworthy than before.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Test Base Layer & App Skeleton

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Test Base Layer & App Skeleton) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 5
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-31 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: React (Vite) rebuild, full 8-page parity, not incremental vanilla enhancement
- Roadmap: API tests come before Playwright — E2E on an untested API inverts the pyramid
- Roadmap: CI ends at a published Docker image, not a live deploy (hosting not purchased)
- Roadmap: Cutover (CUT-01) is its own phase, gated on a full real gameweek cycle
- [Phase 01]: Human approved full 13-package [SUS] install set for Phase 1 (react-router@7, @tanstack/react-query@5, vite@7.3.6, @vitejs/plugin-react@5.2.0, lucide-react, typescript-eslint, eslint-plugin-react-refresh, @types/node, vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, responses[PyPI]) plus clean-verdict packages and two deliberate downgrade pins (typescript@6.0.3, vite@7.3.6+plugin-react@5.2.0) — Verbatim answer: Approved. Delivered via blocking-human gate, unblocks installs in plans 01-03/01-04.
- [Phase 01]: Task 2 tdd=true task writes contract tests against an already-correct, unmodified production endpoint (test-only file list) — RED phase does not apply; all 17 new tests passed on first run as characterization tests, documented in SUMMARY TDD Gate Compliance section.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- **Time-critical, independent of this milestone:** the daily snapshot cron must run every day — price-model history cannot be backfilled (first snapshot 2026-08-31; model unlocks at 14 days). Phase 6 cron changes must not interrupt it.
- **Phase 3 unknown:** FPL shirt/kit CDN URL patterns are unverified community knowledge. Must be captured from live devtools before building the shirt component; trademark posture must be documented, not deferred.
- **Phase 5 unknown:** Python 3.14 (`cp314`) wheel availability for LightGBM, scikit-learn, PyArrow, PuLP is in flux. Verify on PyPI before finalizing the lockfile.
- **Milestone invariant:** the vanilla site stays live and authoritative until CUT-01 completes.
- Payment gateway / merchant-of-record choice still pending with the user — out of scope here, but PITCH-01's trademark disclaimer feeds the eventual gateway review.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close, most recent first:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At | Milestone |
